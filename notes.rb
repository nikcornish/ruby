# PUTS VS PRINTS. ========================================================================

# puts creates line breaks at beginning and end of output, while
# print makes no line breaks at the beginning and end of output. 

# use "puts" for general output and
# use "print" for joining things together

# eg:
# print "print joins lines "
# print "together and doesn't end with a line break."

# puts ""

# puts "while puts makes "
# puts "new lines and a line break at the end."
